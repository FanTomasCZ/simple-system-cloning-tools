Simple System Cloning and Management scripts
============================================


What is this?
-------------

A simple set of tools for system cloning using multicasting on a local
network and system image management using a virtual machine (QEMU)
e.g. for system image updating. Remote machines are rebooted using
Intel AMT.

Rebooting with `PXE-boot` using Intel AMT has not been well tested due
to faulty hardware I had access to. A workaround is to change boot
order to try PXE first (which has its security issues).

It has been done as a part of Master's Thesis entitled:

 ,,Reinstalling and updating Linux remotely and automatically''


Requirements
------------

 * bash
 * udp-cast (please use a recent version)
 * amtterm (please use at least v1.3)
 * qemu-kvm (non-kvm versions should work too)
 * dnsmasq (for PXE serving)
 * tcl/tk expect
 * OpenSSH (ssh client only)

Note1: Debian (Ubuntu probably too) have old versions of required
       packages. Make sure to get newer ones.
Note2: In case of using qemu-kvm WITHOUT kvm modules it is required to
       pass additional `qemu_opts=-no-kvm`. Otherwise it won't boot.


How to use it?
--------------

An example usage of vm-run:

	env image=archlinux.img vm-run \
		'pacman -Syu --noconfirm'

An example usage of net-flash:

	# Setup PXE environment using `dnsmasq`
	dnsmasq -d -F 10.0.0.100,10.0.0.200 \
		--enable-tftp --tftp-root=/srv/pxe

	# Start flashing procedure
	#   `script` should point to a script file (one of
	#            src/server/scripts)
	#   `machines` is a space-separated list of machines to flash
	#              (should be list of AMT-remote accessiable addresses!)
	#   `iface` required if there are more than one interfaces as
	#           udpcast binds to first one available
	#   `AMT_PASSWORD` may be set earlier and exported
	cat archlinux.img \
		| env AMT_PASSWORD='...' \
		      iface=eth2 \
		      script=scripts/send \
		      machines='10.0.0.151 10.0.0.152 10.0.0.160' \
		  net-flash


Directories:
------------

	src/buildroot/.config -- contains configuration used when creating
	                         initramfs and kernel images for PXE booting
	src/buildroot/fs/skeleton -- contains init scripts that are required
	                             in the initramfs
	src/guest-os/ -- contains example script to use for remote
	                 management via virtual machine
	src/ -- contains scripts used for disk image cloning and
	        management
	pxe/ -- contains a prebuilt kernel and initramfs for system cloning
	        and PXE configuration


To do:
------

 - system cloning recovery in case at least one machine fails to
   receive a complete image
 - image checksumming
 - image compression (may yield performance benefits, but may also
   yield performance degradation)
 - secure udpcast transfer initialisation using asymmetric keys
 - expand this README file
 - smarter interface binding in net-flash (udp-sender)
